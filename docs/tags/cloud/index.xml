      <description>Why? Lets start off with a few notes about how and why I would do this. I already have a fireproof/waterproof drive in my house. Sounds like im all set right? Not really.
Although im set on a disaster level there are a few things that can be an issue with onsite backups. Especially with my drive being plugged in all the time.
 Theft, Although it is &amp;ldquo;theft resistant&amp;rdquo; the metal they want me to bolt down isnt very strong at all.</description>

      <description>&lt;amp-img src=&#34;https://silocitylabs.com/uploads/2018/11/22-501-073_R01.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;ioSafe SOLO G3 4TB USB 3.0&#34; height=&#34;960&#34; width=&#34;1280&#34; layout=&#34;responsive&#34;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;
    

&lt;p&gt;I accidentally stumbled upon this solution while trying to find cloud providers to backup my 2TB&amp;rsquo;s worth of NAS backups. With every single cloud solution being out of price range for the size data I needed I had to look elsewhere. I came across the ioSafe Solo G3 enclosure. It boasts about being safe in every way possible, Fire Proof, Water Proof, and Theft Proof. I almost considered it too good to be true, seemed legit enough after watching some YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
