      <guid>https://silocitylabs.com/post/projects/atto-com/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was hired for this company to perform SEO, shortly after google had scheduled the release of a new search algorithm that would reduce views on pages that were not mobile complaint. ATTO got the effect of this with a 50% drop in traffic in a matter of days. A website with over a million views a month it needed to be overhauled. I was tasked with a complete redesign on the website and its 800+ pages. I monitored and improved SEO on the pages over time as well as slowly gained back that 50% loss in traffic. You can checkout the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/ldrrp/detail/project/945228877/contributors/&#34;&gt;other contributors&lt;/a&gt; for refferences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
