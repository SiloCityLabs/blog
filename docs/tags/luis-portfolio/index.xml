&lt;p&gt;The Issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously on Wordpress we started noticing performance issues early on into the websites time on the web. Wordpress unfortunately is not very good with performance on high traffic websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Solution:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We decided to try out a static site generator called hugo. After migrating we noticed extreme performance improvements. We made some more adjustments while the project was hot and decided to host on github public repo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout my time working with kafka I have developed great software to use with it. But while the software did many things there are other things I still resorted to this cheat sheet for. I have put together this list of commands which I will keep updated here as I find new links and commands that help. My kafka installtion was under &lt;code&gt;/opt/kafka&lt;/code&gt; and you will need to change this to your path you installed kafka too. You can also create a symlink and just copy paste commands as they are after changing ip&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my time working for the buffalo news I made many changes to the website. I handled and wrote the mobile api for applications to pull data for the website. I also made visual changes on the website including new styles, layout changes and more. I assisted staff on making changes required in a fashionable time. Other tasks included following up with customers about specific issues for troubleshooting. We used php as the main language for a system powered by wordpress. Also optimized and wrote code for wordpress plugins and other integrations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>COD Random Class Generator</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COD RCG is a random class generator that random generates classes for anyone who plays call of duty to enjoy. This provides new enjoyment for the game e.g. it may choose a gun the player has never used.  It also brings more challenge because you never know what you’re going to get as a class, it could be good or it could put you at a huge disadvantage, but that’s where the fun comes in trying to win and do well in the game when you’re using this crazy class that you normally would not. We launched this website less than a week after call of duty came out. I created my own algorithms to randomly create a class based on the “create a class” system used in Call of Duty. It was a challenge because there are tons of possible class possibilities that can be created. So once I finished that I then had to go and make sure all the gun, attachment, camos, equipment, perks and score streaks were all named correctly. This site and app has been pretty popular with over 25,000,000 views and over 5,000,000 classes generated. The Android app has over 50k installs&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>After hearing that they have been trying to contact a company for the purchase of atto.com for 16 years, I figured I could give it a shot. I helped ATTO Technology locate the correct point of contact in a +10000 employee company to initiate negotiations of the acquisition for the 4 letter domain name. We acquired the Domain name by the end of July.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was hired for this company to perform SEO, shortly after google had scheduled the release of a new search algorithm that would reduce views on pages that were not mobile complaint. ATTO got the effect of this with a 50% drop in traffic in a matter of days. A website with over a million views a month it needed to be overhauled. I was tasked with a complete redesign on the website and its 800+ pages. I monitored and improved SEO on the pages over time as well as slowly gained back that 50% loss in traffic.

&lt;p&gt;In my time working with Pixelmon team I played a role of working with multiple parts of the team due to my vast experience developing. Pixelmon was a hybrid game mode with minecraft and pokemon mixed in an open world game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the game faced some pushback including dmca takedown notice from Nintendo themselves which resulted in all development ending. The game had user created content that was similar to the real game pokemon but created by hand as to avoid copyright infringement. It seems that Nintendo still carried on with the takedown however.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My commitment to security is always a goal of mine. The &amp;lsquo;industry standard&amp;rsquo; network looking glass now faces a pretty nasty XSS vulnerability which is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/telephone/LookingGlass/tree/4367733198698c4d314c51731e0b480b7d0383b3&#34;&gt;listed on github&lt;/a&gt; and I discovered. An RDNS XSS was disclosed which has been patched by a temporary fix I applied to it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
