      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout my time working with kafka I have developed great software to use with it. But while the software did many things there are other things I still resorted to this cheat sheet for. I have put together this list of commands which I will keep updated here as I find new links and commands that help. My kafka installtion was under &lt;code&gt;/opt/kafka&lt;/code&gt; and you will need to change this to your path you installed kafka too. You can also create a symlink and just copy paste commands as they are after changing ip&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
