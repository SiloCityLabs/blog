Wordpress unfortunately is not very good with performance on high traffic websites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Solution:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We decided to try out a static site generator called hugo. After migrating we noticed extreme performance improvements. We made some more adjustments while the project was hot and decided to host on github public repo.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>After hearing that they have been trying to contact a company for the purchase of atto.com for 16 years, I figured I could give it a shot. I helped ATTO Technology locate the correct point of contact in a +10000 employee company to initiate negotiations of the acquisition for the 4 letter domain name. We acquired the Domain name by the end of July.&#xA;You can checkout the other contributors for refferences.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was hired for this company to perform SEO, shortly after google had scheduled the release of a new search algorithm that would reduce views on pages that were not mobile complaint. ATTO got the effect of this with a 50% drop in traffic in a matter of days. A website with over a million views a month it needed to be overhauled. I was tasked with a complete redesign on the website and its 800+ pages. I monitored and improved SEO on the pages over time as well as slowly gained back that 50% loss in traffic.
