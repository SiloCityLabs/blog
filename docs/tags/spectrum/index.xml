      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the process I found while setting up a new service for my brother at his house. This will only work for new customers. The address has to have no existing connections for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Intro call, During this call you will call and ask about pricing to see if you are willing to activate a new service. You will need to seem uninterested and are willing to go without internet. Don&amp;#8217;t make it brief. Keep it going to get more info. Ask about promotional pricing for 400mbps plans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
