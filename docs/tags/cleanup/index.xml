      <description>&lt;p&gt;Updated in May 2021&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Over the last few years me and my wife have been using the network server more frequently from its initial install and setup. We share 3-4 computers across the house and constantly move files onto the NAS. I have installed Nextcloud which I will detail in another post in the future. We have come across an issue that I have noticed with the network share. We moved all of our images and files over and ended up with tons of duplicates and a giant mess. I will show you what I am doing to clean that up. Our Nas is running on a ubuntu server. The following commands should work on most linux NAS servers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
