      <description>Why? Lets start off with a few notes about how and why I would do this. I already have a fireproof/waterproof drive in my house. Sounds like im all set right? Not really.
Although im set on a disaster level there are a few things that can be an issue with onsite backups. Especially with my drive being plugged in all the time.
 Theft, Although it is &amp;ldquo;theft resistant&amp;rdquo; the metal they want me to bolt down isnt very strong at all.</description>

&lt;p&gt;I accidentally stumbled upon this solution while trying to find cloud providers to backup my 2TB&amp;rsquo;s worth of NAS backups. With every single cloud solution being out of price range for the size data I needed I had to look elsewhere. I came across the ioSafe Solo G3 enclosure. It boasts about being safe in every way possible, Fire Proof, Water Proof, and Theft Proof. I almost considered it too good to be true, seemed legit enough after watching some YouTube videos.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With new most asus routers you can use a feature called dual wan. I have the luxury of having a work provided cell phone I am using for this. Before having that I had a free service called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freedompop.com/phone&#34;&gt;freedompop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use cases (mainly mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching netflix withouth interuptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup internet for home security system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything internet&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off we plugin a cell phone to the routers usb port.&lt;/p&gt;
