      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will be using two &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.silocitylabs.com/post/2018/01/01/flashing-merlin-to-tm-ac1900-or-ac68u/&#34;&gt;Custom firmware&lt;/a&gt; routers to get full house coverage on a very old house with thick lead filled walls. The entire project took 6 hours due to some unexpected issues we faced. You can flash any device below as well to &lt;a href=&#34;https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/&#34;&gt;Merlin custom firmware&lt;/a&gt; but its entirely optional. This will work with the stock firmware.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Very few people know that you can save yourself some money by buying a &lt;a href=&#34;http://a.tra.li/Smz7&#34;&gt;T-mobile router on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Downside is having to flash it to have the latest firmware free of vulnerabilities. In this guide I will show you how to flash a TM-AC1900 to a RT-AC68U then into merlin custom firmware. I have tested it myself and can confirm that it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Asus began rolling back firmware on the stock setups. They are not providing Merlin with the source for Ai-Mesh so you need to be on stock to use it. I have updated the guide to provide instructions on how to prevent the rollback from happening. You can also use this guide to recover from a rollback.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
