      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;lazy&#34; src=&#34;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7&#34; data-src=&#34;https://silocitylabs.com/uploads/2026/negative-chamfer-header.webp&#34; alt=&#34;OpenSCAD pins with positive and negative chamfer&#34;/&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, OpenSCAD has become my main 3D modeling program. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly powerful for parametric models but it&amp;rsquo;s also brain-intensive. I speed up development with the BOSL2 library. Many BOSL2 objects have built-in rounding features so I don&amp;rsquo;t need to invoke &lt;code&gt;minkowski()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A trick with BOSL2 is negative rounding. Instead of cutting a corner, it makes the corner stick out. This is very useful for smoothing sharp edges, tapering pin holes, and generally filleting odd shapes. Make an object with negative rounding/chamfer, then use it to cut another object with subtract().&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we first entered 3d printing we started off quickly printing many and many objects. Slowly our printer started to die down once the printer began acting up. Our current printer the Robox rbx1 became the most pain in the ass printer we saw online. Everything was due to the proprietary software and the lack of 3rd party parts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We started to try and simplify remote access by using Teamviewer and even went as far as to buy a CEL Root SD card. The CEL Root was even worse than our current methods. This is when we finally had it. We wanted an open source printer with a decent bed, 3rd party parts, and Octoprint support.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Together me and my team came up with the list of hobby printers under $2000. We&amp;rsquo;ll get a decent filament printer now and a small resin printer later.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
