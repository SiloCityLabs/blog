&lt;p&gt;In my time working with Pixelmon team I played a role of working with multiple parts of the team due to my vast experience developing. Pixelmon was a hybrid game mode with minecraft and pokemon mixed in an open world game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately the game faced some pushback including dmca takedown notice from Nintendo themselves which resulted in all development ending. The game had user created content that was similar to the real game pokemon but created by hand as to avoid copyright infringement. It seems that Nintendo still carried on with the takedown however.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
