      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I will talk about my server setup by request. I setup my server originally for Security cameras because I was tired of proprietary software that every different camera has. My setup right now includes 4 entirely different types of cameras. None of them officially support ONVIF. Every one of my cameras was free so quality was not something I cared for. Today, my server now has my Windows File share (Samba), offsite Sync, Software Raid, Crontab Network Speed monitoring and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zoneminder.com/&#34;&gt;zoneminder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Many have heard the term speed test, the first thing that comes to mind is speedtest.net or google&amp;rsquo;s speed test tool. Many don&amp;rsquo;t know that speed on your internal network also affects you. When testing internet speed your device sends data to router then out to the internet, what if your router is the issue. Even worse, your device. I will show u a very handy utility I use to make sure everything in my house runs great. Its called &lt;a href=&#34;https://iperf.fr/iperf-download.php&#34;&gt;iPerf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the process I found while setting up a new service for my brother at his house. This will only work for new customers. The address has to have no existing connections for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Intro call, During this call you will call and ask about pricing to see if you are willing to activate a new service. You will need to seem uninterested and are willing to go without internet. Don&amp;rsquo;t make it brief. Keep it going to get more info. Ask about promotional pricing for 400mbps plans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I will be using two &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.silocitylabs.com/post/2018/01/01/flashing-merlin-to-tm-ac1900-or-ac68u/&#34;&gt;Custom firmware&lt;/a&gt; routers to get full house coverage on a very old house with thick lead filled walls. The entire project took 6 hours due to some unexpected issues we faced. You can flash any device below as well to &lt;a href=&#34;https://asuswrt.lostrealm.ca/&#34;&gt;Merlin custom firmware&lt;/a&gt; but its entirely optional. This will work with the stock firmware.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
