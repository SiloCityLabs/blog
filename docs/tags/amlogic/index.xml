      <description>&lt;p&gt;Theres a few ways on the amlogic chips to recover boxes, but theres also many ways to recover these units. I will talk about which I have used and others.

I will start off with the basics and work my way up to the more advanced methods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disclosure:&#xA;Everything in this document was sourced from somewhere online.
