      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I will talk about my server setup by request. I setup my server originally for Security cameras because I was tired of proprietary software that every different camera has. My setup right now includes 4 entirely different types of cameras. None of them officially support ONVIF. Every one of my cameras was free so quality was not something I cared for. Today, my server now has my Windows File share (Samba), offsite Sync, Software Raid, Crontab Network Speed monitoring and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zoneminder.com/&#34;&gt;zoneminder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This camera is very dated, also using a proprietary power adapter, no WiFi and very difficult to setup. Once you are on my network you have full viewing access to my camera. My router fortunately has network isolation so I am able to block access to it except via my server that has zoneminder nvr software installed. Unfortunately you will not be able to control the ptz from Zoneminder directly due to the age of the camera. But you can however give it a fixed position in the web panel it has built in. I would recommend setting its default fixed position after a reboot or power loss.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Although I have this particular camera, any basic USB webcam will work the same way. The setup for this one was very simple and its the most stable camera out of my whole setup. There however is no nightvision. I counter this by trigger the lights to turn on if motion sensor is tripped.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;These are just about every cheap camera sold in store. You can buy these at home depot, walmart, and other retailers. Your best bet is craigslist you can get them for like $10 each. They use a basic analog signal you can hookup to a TV with the right connector. The main connector is called a BNC connector. The downside to these cameras is that they usually cap out at 720p. You will also need a PCI or usb device to hook it up to your server. Unless you already have these cameras laying around, I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this setup for purchase. Its cheaper to get a 1080p camera on amazon for $20 with less wiring and no pci card.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;This camera is not listed as officially supporting ONVIF, but it does have it. It barely works so I had to do a workaround to add it in. This camera is a OEM camera, Rosewill just re-branded them. Other models that will most likely work the same way. RSCM-13702B RSCM-13702W RSCM-13101B RSCM-15702 RSCM-121001W&lt;/p&gt;</description>
