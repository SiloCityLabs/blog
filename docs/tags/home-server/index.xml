      <description>Why? Lets start off with a few notes about how and why I would do this. I already have a fireproof/waterproof drive in my house. Sounds like im all set right? Not really.&#xA;Although im set on a disaster level there are a few things that can be an issue with onsite backups. Especially with my drive being plugged in all the time.&#xA;Theft, Although it is &amp;ldquo;theft resistant&amp;rdquo; the metal they want me to bolt down isnt very strong at all.</description>

Today, my server now has my Windows File share (Samba), offsite Sync, Software Raid, Crontab Network Speed monitoring and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zoneminder.com/&#34;&gt;zoneminder&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
