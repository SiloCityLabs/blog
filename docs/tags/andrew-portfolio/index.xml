      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my time working for the buffalo news I made many changes to the website. I handled and wrote the mobile api for applications to pull data for the website. I also made visual changes on the website including new styles, layout changes and more. I assisted staff on making changes required in a fashionable time. Other tasks included following up with customers about specific issues for troubleshooting. We used php as the main language for a system powered by wordpress. Also optimized and wrote code for wordpress plugins and other integrations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>COD Random Class Generator</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;COD RCG is a random class generator that random generates classes for anyone who plays call of duty to enjoy. This provides new enjoyment for the game e.g. it may choose a gun the player has never used.  It also brings more challenge because you never know what you’re going to get as a class, it could be good or it could put you at a huge disadvantage, but that’s where the fun comes in trying to win and do well in the game when you’re using this crazy class that you normally would not. We launched this website less than a week after call of duty came out. I created my own algorithms to randomly create a class based on the “create a class” system used in Call of Duty. It was a challenge because there are tons of possible class possibilities that can be created. So once I finished that I then had to go and make sure all the gun, attachment, camos, equipment, perks and score streaks were all named correctly. This site and app has been pretty popular with over 25,000,000 views and over 5,000,000 classes generated. The Android app has over 50k installs&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://codrcg.com&#34;&gt;Website Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.techreanimate.blackops3&#34;&gt;Android App Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Both of these functions are designed to be used with ob_start() and process the output before its sent to the user. You can also include caching into this to reduce overhead for static pages. It takes the output of the page and makes the content up to 50% smaller in size by removing unused comments and whitespace in code. &lt;a href=&#34;https://downloads.techreanimate.com/auowdk&#34;&gt;Download the file here&lt;/a&gt; or look at the code below.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
