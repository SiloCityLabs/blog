      <description>The reason for this test was to determine if arm was a viable option on aws. I noticed that arm had higher network throughputs and faster disk speeds on the aws pages. So I decided I would compare their performance using golang tests. The entire test cost me $0.68 using a quick spot instance.
The comparison was done on two very similar instances of aws servers. On paper they would almost seem to function the same but arm was just a few cents more, but lets take a look on how they performed.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the process I found while setting up a new service for my brother at his house. This will only work for new customers. The address has to have no existing connections for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Â &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1: Intro call, During this call you will call and ask about pricing to see if you are willing to activate a new service. You will need to seem uninterested and are willing to go without internet. Don&amp;rsquo;t make it brief. Keep it going to get more info. Ask about promotional pricing for 400mbps plans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With new most asus routers you can use a feature called dual wan. I have the luxury of having a work provided cell phone I am using for this. Before having that I had a free service called &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.freedompop.com/phone&#34;&gt;freedompop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use cases (mainly mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watching netflix withouth interuptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Backup internet for home security system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anything internet&amp;hellip;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off we plugin a cell phone to the routers usb port.&lt;/p&gt;
