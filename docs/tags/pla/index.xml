      <description>&lt;p&gt;When we first entered 3d printing we started off quickly printing many and many objects. Slowly our printer started to die down once the printer began acting up. Our current printer the Robox rbx1 became the most pain in the ass printer we saw online. Everything was due to the proprietary software and the lack of 3rd party parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started to try and simplify remote access by using Teamviewer and even went as far as to buy a CEL Root SD card. The CEL Root was even worse than our current methods. This is when we finally had it. We wanted an open source printer with a decent bed, 3rd party parts, and Octoprint support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together me and my team came up with the list of hobby printers under $2000. We&amp;#8217;ll get a decent filament printer now and a small resin printer later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We want a printer that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-has a larger printer volume (CEL Robox: 210x150x100mm, 3150 mÂ³)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-uses open source software&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-doesn&amp;#8217;t need significant modification out of the box&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-supports higher temp materials like nylon&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-supports dual-material or can be upgraded&lt;/p&gt;</description>
