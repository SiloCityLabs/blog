      <description>About I am a software developer that mostly specializes in web development, but I know many other programming languages. I&amp;rsquo;m willing to learn any new languages that will help further my career because I love programming. Right now I work with Techreanimate. I love working with a team because they can help turn a good idea into a great idea. We made a content management system, it has since been converted into our framework called TRA-Framework and we have used this for many of our projects.</description>
