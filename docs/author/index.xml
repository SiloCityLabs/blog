      <description>About As a self-employed software developer right out of high school, I developed websites for other businesses, I created content management systems in English and Spanish of which I am both fluent in. Also developed a framework for multiple software projects.
With my Associate’s Degree in Computer Networking Systems and my experience combined I am able to outperform in the field and create great websites, software and manage infrastructures.</description>

      <description>About I am a software developer that mostly specializes in web development, but I know many other programming languages. I&amp;rsquo;m willing to learn any new languages that will help further my career because I love programming. Right now I work with Techreanimate. I love working with a team because they can help turn a good idea into a great idea. We made a content management system, it has since been converted into our framework called TRA-Framework and we have used this for many of our projects.</description>
