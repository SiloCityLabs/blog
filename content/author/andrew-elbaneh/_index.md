# About

I am a software developer with a primary focus on web development, although my expertise extends to various other programming languages. I am driven by a passion for learning and am always eager to adopt new technologies to enhance my craft and career.

I am the founder of **[One Buffalo Labs](https://onebuffalolabs.com)**, a company specializing in web development and AI solutions. I also manage my own gaming projects under **[Silo City Games](https://silocitygames.com)** and **[One Buffalo Games](https://onebuffalogames.com)**.

I am a proud partner of SiloCityLabs, where I help turn great ideas into impactful projects by focusing on the digital side of open-source electronics and IoT. I am a key contributor to **[SiloCityPages](https://github.com/SiloCityLabs/SiloCityPages)**, a powerful static site generator framework built using Next.js, React, and Bootstrap. It's designed to efficiently generate static websites from source files, making it a flexible and powerful tool for developers. My work is also showcased on my personal portfolio, **[elbaneh.com](https://elbaneh.com)**.

As an avid fan of both video games and Buffalo, NY sports teams (especially the Buffalo Bills), I am always working on my craft, because I feel that you can never learn enough and there is always something new to learn.
