# About
I am a software developer that mostly specializes in web development, but I know many other programming languages. I'm willing to learn any new languages that will help further my career because I love programming. Right now I work with Techreanimate. I love working with a team because they can help turn a good idea into a great idea. We made a content management system, it has since been converted into our framework called TRA-Framework and we have used this for many of our projects. Right now we are working on making our framework the best it can be. I am always working on my craft, because I feel that you can never learn enough and there is always something new to learn.
