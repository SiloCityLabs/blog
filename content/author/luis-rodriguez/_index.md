## About

As a self-employed software developer right out of high school, I developed websites for other businesses, I created content management systems in English and Spanish of which I am both fluent in. Also developed a framework for multiple software projects.

With my Associate’s Degree in Computer Networking Systems and my experience combined I am able to outperform in the field and create great websites, software and manage infrastructures. I would someday like to pursue a Bachelors but the return on investment just isn't there for it yet.
