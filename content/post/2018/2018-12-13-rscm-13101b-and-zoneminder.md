### Rosewill SHIELDeye RSCM-13101B and Zoneminder

![](/uploads/2018/08/81-147-048-Z01.jpg)

#### Details:

This camera is not listed as officially supporting ONVIF, but it does have it. It barely works so I had to do a workaround to add it in. This camera is a OEM camera, Rosewill just re-branded them. Other models that will most likely work the same way. RSCM-13702B RSCM-13702W RSCM-13101B RSCM-15702 RSCM-121001W

#### Setup:

Using the software or app setup the camera for normal streaming first. Afterwards you can add it using the following configuration.
