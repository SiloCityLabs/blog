I wanted to wall mount my google home mini for the kitchen since there is not really a nice place to set it down. I also didnt want to pay for a mount or 3d print anything.

You can use zip ties or bread bag ties to secure the cable in a loop like below.

After u have the 3 ties in place. Just plug it in and you should be set.

If you want a more secure grip for free you can use two methods. Assuming u have common household materials.

  1. Small amount of hot glue where the usb cable is. On the sorrounding, just enought so that you can pull it off if you decide to move it.
  2. Use double sided 3M tape behind the mini to secure it to the wall.
