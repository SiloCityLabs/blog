FBI has been allowed to look at your browsing history and this is what were going to do about it. 

### VPN Protection

We are using [NordVPN](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=20799) to protect our privacy, they offer no logs and no history for the goverment agencies to collect. Currently they are offering 70% off. Click on our affiliate link to support our content when signing up.

NordVPN was noted as the fastes vpn multiple years. We highly recommend them over others.

They have plugins available on this page if you scroll down to ["Protect all your devices"](https://go.nordvpn.net/aff_c?offer_id=15&aff_id=20799) for all devices even iOS and Android. We will be using Android and Chrome plugins.

On certain routers you can enable full home vpn, although its recommended to enable it as a plugin per application.
