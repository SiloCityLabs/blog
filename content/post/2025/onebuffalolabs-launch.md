# Powering Open Innovation: How SiloCityLabs Builds, While One Buffalo Labs Helps Launch

At the heart of Buffalo’s maker scene, **SiloCityLabs** continues to push the boundaries of open-source electronics, IoT, and 3D printing. From ESP32-powered PCBs to smart vent controllers and custom firmware projects, SCL remains focused on what it does best: building cool, accessible tech for hackers, hobbyists, and hardware startups.

But behind every great open-source project is the need for clear documentation, intuitive design, and a solid web presence. That’s where **One Buffalo Labs** comes in.

While SCL prototypes in the lab, OBL helps translate that work into real-world platforms—managing the design, SEO, and performance tuning of digital front doors like [silocitylabs.com](https://silocitylabs.com). They ensure the code and content built by the SCL team reaches the audiences who can use it, remix it, and contribute back.

Whether it’s rolling out new documentation, managing storefront integrations, or supporting open-source landing pages, **OBL allows SCL to stay focused on innovation**, while ensuring Buffalo’s best ideas have a clean, fast, and accessible home online.
