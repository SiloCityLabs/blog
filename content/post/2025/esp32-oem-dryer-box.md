Whether you're working with **PLA, ABS, PETG, Nylon, or specialty filaments**, this upgrade ensures optimal drying conditions to prevent moisture-related print failures.

**Enhanced Display for Better Control**
---------------------------------------

Say goodbye to the standard LCD screen and experience an **upgraded, easy-to-read display**. With clearer, more detailed temperature and humidity readings, you’ll have **real-time insights into your filament drying process**, making adjustments and monitoring easier than ever.
