Managing your 3D printing filament inventory no longer has to involve guesswork.

What is FilaMeter?

FilaMeter is a free filament management app designed for makers, engineers, and hobbyists who need a better way to manage and monitor their spools. Whether you’re working with a few rolls or maintaining a full inventory, this filament tracking system helps ensure you’re always ready for your next print job.

A Lightweight, Powerful 3D Filament Tracker

FilaMeter makes it easy to track the essentials for each spool:

Filament type and color

Total weight and used weight in grams

Weight left (calculated automatically in grams)

Storage location

Comments and custom notes

Each filament entry includes quick action icons for editing, deleting, or duplicating spool data, making spool management fast, reliable, and accessible. It’s your personalized filament roll tracker, designed to eliminate friction and help you stay organized.

No Accounts Required, Just a Valid Email

FilaMeter doesn’t require a traditional username and password. Instead, it uses browser-based storage to recognize returning users. If you want to access FilaMeter across multiple devices, you’ll need to provide a valid email address to enable sync features.

Free vs. Paid: Multi-Device Support and Syncing

The core version of FilaMeter is completely free. It includes all key features and works on a single device with no restrictions. If you want to use FilaMeter on multiple devices, such as your laptop, tablet, and phone, you can do that too. Free users can sync their data manually once every 60 seconds.

For those who prefer a seamless experience, FilaMeter offers a paid version that enables automatic, real-time syncing across all your devices. Subscriptions are available in 1-year, 3-year, or lifetime plans, providing added flexibility for advanced users or teams.

Simplify Updates with FilaMeter Labels

To make FilaMeter even more efficient, we’ve introduced FilaMeter Labels: QR-coded stickers that attach to your spools and link directly to your filament tracking spreadsheet in the web app. Just scan a label to jump to that spool’s entry.

To celebrate the launch, we’re offering 5 free FilaMeter Labels while supplies last. Simply follow the link and add them to your cart to get started.

Future Integration with SpoolSense

FilaMeter is more than just a spool tracker. We’re currently developing SpoolSense, a standalone optical tracking device that monitors filament usage in real time. SpoolSense will integrate directly with FilaMeter to automate usage tracking and help you manage your filament inventory even more effectively.
