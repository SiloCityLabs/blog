Weâ€™re thrilled to announce the return of CODRCG, the Call of Duty Random Class Generator, now fully open source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/SiloCityLabs/codrcg.com)! After shutting down in 2022 due to server costs and code maintenance challenges, we've reimagined CODRCG to thrive on a modern, lightweight platform.
