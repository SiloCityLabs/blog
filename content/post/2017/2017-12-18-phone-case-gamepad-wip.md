Here&#8217;s my primary project, a phone case gamepad. This has been on the backburner for a while and I&#8217;m finally going full steam on it. Major milestones will be posted here on the blog. For the week by week details follow my [HackADay.io project][1]. All project information will be open source and posted on [Github][2].

**WHY:**

![I hate touchscreen controls](/uploads/2017/12/Screenshot_2013-12-20-09-39-43.png)

I want to play action/platformer games on my phone. The straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back was &#8220;Prinny: Can I Really Be the Hero?&#8221; &#8211; I couldn&#8217;t beat a boss because my fingers kept missing the intangible touchscreen controls. I want a gamepad that is compact to carry, comfortable to hold, and works with multiple phones.

**HOW:**

Current plan is an nrf51822 based gamepad in a 3d printed case. Users will be able to 3d print a case for their particular phone and drop in the electronics. When the user gets a new phone, a new case can be made and the electronics transferred.

**INSPIRED BY (R.I.P.):**

Xperia Play, OpenPandora., HTC Dream (G1), DS Lite, PSP
