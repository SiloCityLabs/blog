Going to be creating a receiver to translate 433mhz sensors to smart things, Most likely going to be using a esp8266 to make it easier to configure. I still have to figure out how to identify the smart things hub withouth manually entering in its ip, maybe upnp?

I also bought a CC2530 chip for zigbee testing, Not sure what im going to do with that yet.

Edit: I think I may have made a mistake buying zigbee chips. So turns out zwave may have longer battery life compared to zigbee... shoulda researched more
