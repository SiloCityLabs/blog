<figure class="wp-block-embed">https://tombuildsstuff.blogspot.com/2014/02/diy-server-rack-plans.html Benefits to having a home rack: 

  * Organization
  * Easier to transport
  * Access control I will however state that unless you have more than just your average setup. A home rack is quite useless. There may be far cheaper solutions out there for you. 

### My setup:

  * 21U posts
  * Wood 2&#215;4 frame
  * 4u extra space for shelf.
  * 4U Plex server
  * 4U NAS server + zoneminder
  * 4U Spare server (powered off)
  * PS4 (remote play via ethernet)
  * Smart hub
  * Home Router
  * SB6190 modem
  * 12v 10A power supply
  * 1U power strip
  * 1U shelf + 2x 8 port eco switches Â  

### Designing the rack This part is optional, however it helps me visualize what I can cut from the wood I have laying around. My rack was made of pallet wood which made it entirely free. After laying it out and seeying how long and tall it needed to be based on my servers. I moved on to cutting.

&nbsp;

Assembly

I assembled the peices staring with the front and back frame. Then moving onto peicing the two together. The entire setup i used a kreg jig drill kit with wood screws and the extended bits it came with to peice together the frame. In between each peice of wood i added wood glue for extra strength as well.

&nbsp;

### Installing rails

I purchase the rails online from an audio supply vendor on Amazon (cheapest place).

From the bottom i used a 1U router as a guide and drilled a pilot hole for the mount. Then screwed it into the wood. Then i moved the 1U guide to the top and did the same. I also added a center screw for better support. Do the same for the rear if you want 4 posts.

&nbsp;

Adding wheels

I drilled a pilot hole and found some wheels i recycled. But you can also find them at your nearest Harbor Freight or home depot. Make sure they can support at least 400lbs. I filled the hole with some more wood glue and screwed in the wheels.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After this your all set. Its ready to use. Anything else is an accessory.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Switches

After realizing every switch out there that had the phrase &#8220;rackmount&#8221; costs $200 more i decided to just take a 1U shelf and two $20 gigabit eco switches and have slight redundancy and affordability.

&nbsp;

Power strip

This was cheap on amazon. I love the meter display so I can calculate my electric usage.

&nbsp;

DIY 1U shelf

I basically made this using wood and a side panel from a trash case. I did not want to pay $100 at the time for a shelf this long.

&nbsp;

I had some L rails I slapped it on top off and called it a day.
