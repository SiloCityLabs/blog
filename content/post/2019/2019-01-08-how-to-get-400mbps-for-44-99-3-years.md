This is the process I found while setting up a new service for my brother at his house. This will only work for new customers. The address has to have no existing connections for this to work.

&nbsp;

Step 1: Intro call, During this call you will call and ask about pricing to see if you are willing to activate a new service. You will need to seem uninterested and are willing to go without internet. Don&#8217;t make it brief. Keep it going to get more info. Ask about promotional pricing for 400mbps plans.<!--more-->

Step 2: Go online 4 days later and enter your address on the website for pricing.

Step 3: Keep trying step 2 until you see pricing for 400mpbs for 2 years at $44.99 on the website.

Step 4: Call once you see the pricing on the website 2 days later. Then you will be offered 400mbps for 3 years at $44.99.

This infuriates me about their sales tactics. But it seems that every time you leave a trace on their sales it bumps the plan higher and higher. I&#8217;m not sure how high they are willing to go. This promo worked for Buffalo, NY. Let me know in the comments if you have had any success or have found a way to get into this price lock period for existing customers. I&#8217;m eager to get this speed and pricing for my house with 100mpbs.
