Built from scratch and a team of 1. This app integrates build types and flavours to quickly create another version of the application. The code base for both [The Buffalo News](/post/projects/android-buffalonews) and BN Blitz app are one in the same with simple changes that change how they work in a single config file. This was designed to be allowed to integrate into wordpress api and resold to other news orginizations.

The News’ team has you covered, from training camp to the draft – and every snap in between. Mark Gaughan, Jerry Sullivan, Tim Graham and Jay Skurski lead the coverage with breaking updates and in-depth analysis through daily blogs posts, stories and columns. Plus, video reports and exclusive photos from every game. On game day, get real-time reports from The News’ writers at the game.
