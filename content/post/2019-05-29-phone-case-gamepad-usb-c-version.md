Remember my [Bluetooth gamepad project][1]? It&#8217;s time for a USB-C version. I started with Bluetooth because I thought it would be easier to support multiple phones. However [Hackaday and OSHPark are holding a flex PCB contest][2]. This is a good material to make a gamepad with, and the perfect material for a gamepad that is supposed to resize.

I tried a few mockups and settled on a 2 piece design, with the halves connected by a ribbon cable. The left and right side share the same PCB but have different components attached. The &#8220;main&#8221; side (probably right side) will have most of the components and the USB connector. The &#8220;aux&#8221; side (probably left side) will have just an LED for status indication &#8211; all the button contacts are built into the PCB.

I&#8217;m using SNES buttons for this version. The contest is for 2sq inches of PCB and only the D-Pad silicone will fit in my 2&#215;1 footprint, so I&#8217;ll use two of them. For future versions I&#8217;ll check out button sets for portables like the GBA, DS, and PSP.

PCB layout is in the works. I still have rearranging and routing to do. I may have to change USB-C connectors to something that will fit the trace width of OSHpark.

Follow my [project on HackADay.io][6] for finer details and updates! Source code will be available the SiloCityLabs Github soonâ„¢. This will be completely open source &#8211; PCB, firmware, and 3d printed case.
