Buffalo, NY, known for its harsh winters, requires residents to be prepared for power outages. Generators are a crucial part of this preparedness, offering a reliable power source when the grid fails. This guide delves into the types of generators suitable for Buffalo, along with tips on fuel storage, maintenance, and installation.

## Understanding Generator Options

### Gas Generators

Gas-only generators offer a cost-effective alternative for Buffalo residents seeking a reliable power source. These generators exclusively rely on gasoline, making them a simpler and often more budget-friendly choice. While they lack the dual or tri-fuel versatility, the affordability and widespread availability of gasoline can make them an attractive option for those prioritizing simplicity.

### Dual Fuel Generators

Dual fuel generators are an excellent choice for Buffalo residents due to their long-term fuel storage capabilities. They can run on gasoline or propane, providing flexibility in fuel availability.

### Tri-Fuel Generators

For those seeking the utmost flexibility, tri-fuel generators are the way to go. They can operate on gasoline, propane, or natural gas, making them a versatile choice for varying conditions. You can buy gas now and make a long term plan for implementing natural gas or propane tank purchases.

### Natural Gas Kits

While [natural gas kits](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=generator+natural+gas+conversion+kit) offer a direct line of fuel, they limit the use of propane. This might not be the best option for those who want the flexibility of using propane. But can be a great option for thos only planning to use natural gas.

## Fuel Storage and Maintenance

### Storing Gasoline

For gasoline storage, it’s recommended to use ethanol-free gas, available at most local Delta Sonics and a [few others](https://www.pure-gas.org/NY). Adding a [fuel stabilizer](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=STA-BIL+Storage+Fuel+Stabilizer) is crucial for long-term storage. Avoid using standard E85 or similar fuels as they can cause corrosion and clog fuel lines and carburetors.

### Battery Maintenance

Use a [battery tender](https://www.google.com/search?q=battery+tender&tbm=shop) for storing the generator, or store the battery indoors to ensure it remains charged and ready for use. Cold temps can drop the battery levels to nearly zero and destroy the batteries used for starting a generator.

### Propane Tanks

Standard [store-bought propane tanks](https://www.bluerhino.com/propane-finder/) contain ~15 lbs of fuel. It’s advised to top them off at refill stations like [U-Haul](https://www.uhaul.com/Propane/), which offers affordable rates. Store propane tanks outdoors, using an outdoor cover to protect them from rust and snow. Typically, 2-3 full-capacity tanks (~20 lbs each) are needed for a robust backup fuel source.

## Installation Considerations

### Adding a Natural Gas Line

For tri-fuel generators, adding a high-output natural gas line is essential. Ensure a licensed [plumber](https://www.google.com/maps/search/plumber/@42.9476313,-78.859728,12z/data=!4m3!2m2!5m1!4e9?entry=ttu) installs this, and it’s important not to connect it to existing lines to avoid disrupting your furnaces natural gas supply. Purchasing a [quick connect hose](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=25ft+natural+has+hose+quick+connect) will come with the nessesary outlet for the gas supply.

### Generator Inlet Power

For powering the entire home, consider installing a [NEMA L14 Dual phase inlet](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=L14-30P+Power+Inlet+Box) with an [interlock kit](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=ul+approved+generator+interlock+kit) on your panel. This setup, installed by a professional electrician, allows for more devices to be powered simultaneously without the need for extension cords. A [20ft NEMA L14 cable](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=20ft+l14+generator+cord) is recommended to keep the generator safely distanced from the home.

### Noise Reduction

To reduce noise, tighten any loose bolts and secure handles. I offer a [sound-dampening handle strap](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1396989959/generator-arm-silencer) on my Etsy store, which can significantly decrease noise output.
